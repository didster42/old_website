				There are numerous games which have risen from Half-Life 2 mods. The famous ones include Counter-Strike, Black Mesa and Garry's Mod. Recently, I played another game which was initially created as a Half-Life 2 mod called <strong class="black">'The Stanley Parable'</strong>. I was looking for a story based game to play to stir up creative juices, and after some googling I came across its title and was intrigued by it. The trailer of the game was so mysterious, I couldn't wait to play it. I got it from steam sometime later.

				The game was so fun to play. The dynamic between the narrator and the player reminded me of that between GladOS and Chell in the portal games(created by Valve who made Half-Life 2). The game starts with the narrator narrating a story about 'Stanley', the protagonist of the game whose movement can be controlled by the player. The narrator attempts to guide the player, motivating the player to complete Stanley's story the way it was meant to be completed. However, the player <strong class="black">does have the choice</strong> of not following the requests of the narrator thereby creating other endings to the narrator's story. The narrator tries to adjust these choices in order to complete the story, while interacting with Stanley. I thoroughly enjoyed the subtle easter eggs and fourth wall breaking of the narrator which enabled a very humourous experience. The narrator then proceeded to tackle topics of existentialism, mind control and freedom of choice, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed being part of. Among the multiple possible endings of the game, one ending I really liked was when after constant defiance of the wishes of the narrator, the narrator finally loses it and transports the player to another game, saying, 'You don't like this game? Lets go to another!' The narrator then transports the player to minecraft after which the player is sent to the first level of Portal 1. Playing through these easter eggs was just insane.

				I really enjoyed playing through this game. I would have liked it more if the games' story was longer. However, I need to acknowledge the fact that it has been a decade since the initial release of the game, and this fact just amazes me. I would definitely recommend others to play this experience, especially if your interests align with the themes of the game.
